Joseph Burger</p><p>B.     Donovan v. Dewey</p><p> </p><p>2.      STATUTES:</p><p>A.     CONSTITUTIONAL LAW</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT</p><p>This is an appeal from the final orders of the district court dismissing the claim of the appellant in relation to the unlawful search and seizure conducted by the government authorities through the drones on the property of the appellant. </p><p>As per Rule 4(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the appeal is timely because within 3-0 days of the district court's decision, the Notice of Appeal in this civil case was filed. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p><p> </p><p>     STATEMENT OF ISSUE</p><p> </p><p>1.      Whether the search conducted through drones is lawful? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>    STATEMENT OF FACTS</p><p>Ms. Kimberly Hall runs a small yard on her property surrounded by several fences, tall trees, dense scrub bushes and posted No Trespassing signs. After an anonymous tip reporting operation of multiple automotive chop chops in rural location, the state and local authorities conducted a drone-surveillance. Captured video of the larger structure revealed the presence of multiple dismantled vehicles, a pile of licence plates and various automotive parts and tools. Hall was taken to the police custody and was charged accordingly.</p><p>ARGUMENTS</p><p>The search conducted by the authorities violates the rights of the defendant related to unreasonable search and seizure. The search conducted by the authorities with the help of drones should have been conducted after the warrant of search was issued to the authorities. The property where the search was conducted contains 2 structures, a small one room cabin in which Ms. Halls resides and a separate structure sliding barn doors on all four sides, no windows, and no roof. A person living at his place expects some privacy and any violation of this right shall be negated. </p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Thus, in the present case, the evidence collected by the unlawful means shall not be admissible in evidence against the defendant. The search should have been conducted after permission was taken from the court. </p><p> </p><p>RELIEF</p><p>The appellant must be released and the evidence collected from the unlawful search shall be inadmissible in the court of law. The conviction must be set aside as the search conducted by the defendant is unlawful and against the Fourth Amendment.</p><p><br/></p><p> </p></div>
